## Installation

### Software requirements

- Node.js 20 or higher: see [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/);
- Electron 23 or higher: please install it with `npm i electron` _if you use Microsoft Authentication_.

To get all the capacities of this Node.js library, you must set up your [EML AdminTool](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool) website! Without it, you can only use Minecraft Vanilla, and many features will be disabled (such as News, Bootstrap, etc.).

If you don't want to use EML AdminTool, you should rather use the [Minecraft Launcher Core](https://npmjs.com/package/minecraft-launcher-core) library.

### EML Lib installation

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [Electron](https://electronjs.org).

```bash
# Using npm
npm i eml-lib
```

`eml-lib` package includes TypeScript typings, so you don't need to install `@types/eml-lib`.

### Quick start

Quick start using the [EML AdminTool](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool):

```js
const EMLLib = require('eml-lib')

const launcher = new EMLLib.Launcher({
  url: 'https://admintool.electron-minecraft-launcher.com',
  serverId: 'eml',
  account: new EMLLib.CrackAuth().auth('GoldFrite')
})

launcher.launch()
```

Please refer to the [docs](https://emlproject.pages.dev/docs/set-up-environment) for more information.
