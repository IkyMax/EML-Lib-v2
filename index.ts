 *
 * ---
 *
 * **Requirements:**
 * - Node.js 15.14.0 or higher: see [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/);
 * - Electron 15.0.0 or higher: please install it with `npm i electron` _if you use
 * Microsoft Authentication_.
 *
 * **Recommandations:**
 * - To get all the capacities of this Node.js library, you must set up your
 * [EML AdminTool](https://github.com/Electron-Minecraft-Launcher/EML-AdminTool) website!
 * - If you don't want to use the EML AdminTool, you should rather use the
 * [Minecraft Launcher Core](https://npmjs.com/package/minecraft-launcher-core) library.
